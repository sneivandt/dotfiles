# ShellCheck configuration for dotfiles project
# https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/

# Enforce POSIX sh compatibility (not bash)
shell=sh

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# SC1091: Not following sourced file
#   - Dotfiles use dynamic sourcing patterns that shellcheck can't follow
#   - Variables like $DIR are used in source paths
#   - Safe to disable globally for this project
# SC3043: 'local' is non-POSIX
#   - We use 'local' extensively for proper scoping
#   - Supported by all modern shells (dash, bash, zsh, ash)
# SC2154: Referenced but not assigned
#   - Variables like $DIR, $OPT, $PROFILE are exported by dotfiles.sh
#   - Color variables are sourced from logger.sh
disable=SC1090,SC1091,SC3043,SC2154

# Enable optional checks:
# SC2034: foo appears unused. Verify it or export it.
