# ShellCheck configuration for dotfiles project
# https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/

# Enforce POSIX sh compatibility (not bash)
shell=sh

# Disabled checks with justification:
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting
#   - Intentionally disabled in specific cases where word splitting is desired
#   - Must use inline directive (# shellcheck disable=SC2086) where needed
#   - Do not globally disable; keep inline for visibility

# SC2154: var is referenced but not assigned
#   - Variables exported from dotfiles.sh (DIR, OPT, PROFILE) are sourced
#   - Variables from logger.sh (BLUE, NC, etc.) are sourced
#   - Must use inline directive where the variable is defined elsewhere
#   - Keep inline for visibility of cross-file dependencies

# SC2059: Don't use variables in the printf format string
#   - We carefully control format strings in logger.sh
#   - Must use inline directive (# shellcheck disable=SC2059) where needed
#   - Do not globally disable; keep inline for visibility

# Enable optional checks:
# SC2034: foo appears unused. Verify it or export it.
enable=avoid-nullary-conditions
enable=check-unassigned-uppercase

# Additional directives
# Use 'source' for sourcing, not '.'
# external-sources=true
