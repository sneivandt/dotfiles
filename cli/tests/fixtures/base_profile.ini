# Minimal base-profile fixture
#
# Represents the smallest valid `symlinks.ini` for a base-profile
# integration test — a single symlink whose source exists in the
# `symlinks/` directory of the test repository.
#
# Usage: write this file to `conf/symlinks.ini` in the temp repo,
# then call `TestContextBuilder::with_symlink_source("bashrc")` so
# that validation does not warn about a missing file.
