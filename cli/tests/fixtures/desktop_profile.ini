# Minimal desktop-profile fixture
#
# Represents the smallest valid `symlinks.ini` for a desktop-profile
# integration test.  Includes entries from both the `base` and `desktop`
# sections so that `Config::load` with the desktop profile returns items
# from both.
#
# Usage: write this file to `conf/symlinks.ini` in the temp repo and create
# the corresponding source files with `TestContextBuilder::with_symlink_source`.
