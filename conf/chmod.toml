# File permissions to apply
# Each section represents a profile
# Format: mode and path (relative to home directory)
#
# Note: When applying mode to a directory, chmod -R is used which applies
# the mode recursively to ALL files and subdirectories. Consider this when
# setting directory permissions (e.g., 755 will apply to all contents).
