# Manifest file for sparse checkout configuration
# Lists which files belong to exclusion categories: windows, arch, desktop
#
# Format: paths relative to symlinks/ directory (prefix not included in paths)
# These paths are prefixed with symlinks/ when generating sparse checkout patterns
# Directories should end with /
# Individual files listed explicitly
#
# IMPORTANT - OR Logic for Multi-Category Sections:
# Unlike other config files, this file uses OR logic for multi-category sections.
# [arch-desktop] means "exclude if arch OR desktop is excluded" (not both required).
# This ensures files shared by multiple categories are excluded when ANY category is excluded.
#
# Examples:
#   [arch-desktop] - File excluded if EITHER arch OR desktop is excluded
#   Other config files (symlinks.toml, packages.toml, etc.) use AND logic:
#   [arch-desktop] - Section included only if BOTH arch AND desktop are active
#
# Note: Files in the [base] profile category do not need to be listed here
# since base files are never excluded - they're included in all profiles.
# Only list files that should be excluded in certain profiles.
