# Profile definitions for sparse checkout
# Maps profile names to include/exclude categories
#
# Categories: windows, arch, desktop
# Each profile defines what to include or exclude
#
# Note: System auto-detection overrides may apply:
#   - Non-Arch Linux systems always exclude 'arch' category
#   - Linux systems always exclude 'windows' category
# These overrides ensure compatibility regardless of profile selection.
